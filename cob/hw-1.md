# Homework 1

## Assignment

*originally due at the start of class on Thursday 2/6; extended to Tuesday 2/11*

1.  **Browse some historical electronics texts and find an experiment of interest.** It could be interesting because you think it's strange, beautiful, confusing, exciting, or for any other reason. I've compiled a [short list of historical texts here]({{site.baseurl}}/cob/historical-texts.html) which you may find as a useful starting point. There are many other sources for these sorts of documents! For instance, try a Google Books search, or do your own search of [archive.org](https://archive.org/).

1.  **Post a very brief summary of the project** as well as a link to the page the experiment is on. This should be posted on the Google Doc which is linked from the main Block 5 assignment sheet (that link isn't posted here). When you're doing the submission, please use this format:  
your first name  
brief description  
the URL of the project

1.  **You will briefly share out** this experiment at the start of class on Thursday 2/11.

## Example submission

An example of what you should post on the assignment document (to complete assignment part 2):

>Pat  
>This is a drawing of a model of an experiment that Michael Faraday
performed, where he built a large cage with wires going around the
outside and discovered that adding an electrical charge to the wall of
the cage didn't affect anything inside of it.
