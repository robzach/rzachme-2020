    <ul>
      <li>This is a very grisly description of experiments performed on the body of an executed criminal; there is no mention of the decedent’s consent. The “research” consists of dissection and electrical stimulation applied to various points on the body. Its scientific value is probably nil, but it’s useful as a historical document illustrating the sorts of uncontrolled experiments on humans which used to be perfectly permissible.</li>

      <li>Linked is book one; there are at least seven volumes which progress in their technical complexity, and which are also available at the Internet Archive. Great quote from the title page: “The thought is in the question. The information is in the answer.”</li>

      <li>really nice color spreads of EMF and audible spectra on p. 4</li>
