<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<p><em>originally due at the start of class on Thursday 2/6; extended to Tuesday 2/11</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Browse some historical electronics texts and find an experiment of interest.</strong> It could be interesting because you think it’s strange, beautiful, confusing, exciting, or for any other reason. I’ve compiled a <a href="/cob/historical-texts.html">short list of historical texts here</a> which you may find as a useful starting point. There are many other sources for these sorts of documents! For instance, try a Google Books search, or do your own search of <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Post a very brief summary of the project</strong> as well as a link to the page the experiment is on. This should be posted on the Google Doc which is linked from the main Block 5 assignment sheet (that link isn’t posted here). When you’re doing the submission, please use this format:<br />
your first name<br />
brief description<br />
the URL of the project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You will briefly share out</strong> this experiment at the start of class on Thursday 2/11.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="example-submission">Example submission</h2>

<p>An example of what you should post on the assignment document (to complete assignment part 2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pat<br />
This is a drawing of a model of an experiment that Michael Faraday
performed, where he built a large cage with wires going around the
outside and discovered that adding an electrical charge to the wall of
the cage didn’t affect anything inside of it.<br />
