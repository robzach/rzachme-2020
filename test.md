![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/house.png) I'm a [teacher](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rzachari/), builder, ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/house.png) artist, and bicycle person.

Most people call me Zach.

I'm happy to report that I live in Pittsburgh, the Paris of Western Pennsylvania.

Some recent/current projects:

* Guest teaching a [class on Physical Computing]({{site.url}}/cob.html) at the new [City of Bridges High School](https://cityofbridgeshighschool.org/) on the South Side of Pittsburgh
* [Project Amelia](https://www.bricolagepgh.org/programs/program-listings/projectamelia/), an immersive theater piece exploring AI, capitalism, and their intersections with morality
* [Resonant Bodies](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com/resonant-body.html), a collaboration with [slowdanger](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com), for which I contributed technically and creatively to a novel tactile speaker and movement-responsive on-body sensors
