# Robert Zacharias

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rgz.jpg)

I'm a [teacher](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rzachari/), builder, artist, and bicycle person.

Most people call me Zach.

I'm happy to report that I live in Pittsburgh, the Paris of Western Pennsylvania.

Some recent/current projects:

* Co-teaching and co-developing a high-school summer course, *Engineering through Music and Fashion*; collaboration with CMU postdoc [Judith Uchidiuno](https://judithu.com/)
* Co-developing [ioRef](https://ioref.org): a system of reference cards, a linked web knowledge resource, and a customized version of schematic-drawing software for helping to teach physical computing to neophyte learners; collaboration with IDeATe faculty members [Marti Louw](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/marti-louw) (Human Computer Interaction Institute) and [Daragh Byrne](http://daraghbyrne.me/) (School of Architecture)
* Co-developing *[Remote Possibilities](remotepossibilities.splashthat.com)*, an interactive web-based performance allowing for live, remote, interactive dance performance during the pandemic; collaboration with [slowdanger](slowdangerslowdanger.com) and [Kevin DeLand](http://delandbeforeti.me/) ([project trailer](https://vimeo.com/511294454); [Post-Gazette writeup](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2021/03/18/Slowdanger-delivers-interactive-virtual-dance-experience-in-remote-possibilities/stories/202103180010))
* Guest teaching a [class on Physical Computing]({{site.url}}/cob.html) at the new [City of Bridges High School](https://cityofbridgeshighschool.org/) on the South Side of Pittsburgh
* **Tranquil** interactive artwork. Part of [Project Amelia](https://www.bricolagepgh.org/programs/program-listings/projectamelia/), an immersive theater piece exploring AI, capitalism, and their intersections with morality
* [Resonant Bodies](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com/resonant-body.html), a collaboration with [slowdanger](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com), for which I contributed technically and creatively to a novel tactile speaker and movement-responsive on-body sensors

My [portfolio]({{site.url}}/portfolio.html) page is partial at the moment, but has some pictures to look at.

At CMU, my students have lately made some great stuff:

* [Intro to Physical Computing](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2022) students made four really interesting assistive devices for community members living with disability; see [their final documentation](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2022/work/category/final-project/final-documentation/) for details.
* [Electronic Logics && Creative Practice](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/62-362/f2021) students produced a wide range of artful, expressive, surprising, and wonderful interactive pieces for our final show, called **Between Air and Waterlines**. See [their documentation](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/62-362/f2021/category/projects/project-3/) for more.

<!--
In 2017 I wrote a thesis towards a Masters in Tangible Interaction Design from CMU. Here are the [webpage version]({{site.baseurl}}/thesis.html) and the [PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/thesis.pdf).

In case you hadn't noticed, I have channeled all my web-design energies into making hovering over the links on this page exciting. (You're welcome.)

More documentation, writing, photos, and projects forthcoming! If you want to write me, I'm at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#114;&#122;&#64;&#114;&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#114;&#122;&#64;&#114;&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a>
