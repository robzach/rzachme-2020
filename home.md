I'm a [teacher](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rzachari/), builder, artist, and bicycle person.

Most people call me Zach.

I'm happy to report that I live in Pittsburgh, the Paris of Western Pennsylvania.

Some recent/current projects:

* Guest teaching a [class on Physical Computing]({{site.url}}/cob.html) at the new [City of Bridges High School](https://cityofbridgeshighschool.org/) on the South Side of Pittsburgh
* **Tranquil** interactive artwork. Part of [Project Amelia](https://www.bricolagepgh.org/programs/program-listings/projectamelia/), an immersive theater piece exploring AI, capitalism, and their intersections with morality
* [Resonant Bodies](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com/resonant-body.html), a collaboration with [slowdanger](http://www.slowdangerslowdanger.com), for which I contributed technically and creatively to a novel tactile speaker and movement-responsive on-body sensors

My [portfolio]({{site.url}}/portfolio.html) page is partial at the moment, but has some pictures to look at.

At CMU, my students have recently made some great stuff:

* [Intro to Physical Computing](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2020) students made eight really interesting assistive devices for older community members, despite finishing the semester entirely remotely; see [their final documentation](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2020/work/category/final-project/final-documentation/) for details.
* [Activating the Body](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/62-362/f2019) students produced a wonderful range of artful, expressive, surprising, and wonderful interactive pieces for our final show, called **Every Possible Utterance**. See [CMU's documentation](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2019/december/every-possible-utterance.html) (quick overview photos), and the students' own [final documentation](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/62-362/f2019/category/projects/project-3/) (much more in-depth exploration).

In 2017 I wrote a thesis towards a Masters in Tangible Interaction Design from CMU. Here are the [webpage version]({{site.baseurl}}/thesis.html) and the [PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/thesis.pdf).

In case you hadn't noticed, I have channeled all my web-design energies into making hovering over the links on this page exciting. (You're welcome.)

More documentation, writing, photos, and projects forthcoming! If you want to write me, I'm at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#114;&#122;&#64;&#114;&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#114;&#122;&#64;&#114;&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a>
